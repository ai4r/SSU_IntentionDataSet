## Training data for learning the activity intention model of the elderly
```description01
   This repository contains data set to build the activity intention model of the elderly. 
   This data was collected by performing a project of MSIP/IITP. 
   If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact us by email [phkchr09@gmail.com].
```

### 데이터 개요
```description03
   In this project, the activity intention model was learned based on 55 types of actions, 10 types of poses and 4 types of IoT sensor information. Therefore, this data is composed of action, pose, IoT sensor and activity intention.
